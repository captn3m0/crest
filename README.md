Simple HTTP and REST client for Crystal, inspired by the Ruby's RestClient gem.

## Installation

Add this to your application's `shard.yml`:

```yaml
dependencies:
  crest:
    github: mamantoha/crest
```

## Usage

```crystal
require "crest"
```

Basic usage:

```crystal
Crest.get("http://example.com/resource", params: {:lang => "ua"})
Crest.post("http://example.com/resource", payload: {:params1 => "one", :nested => {:params2 => "two"}})
```

### Passing advanced options

`Crest::Request` accept next parameters:

Mandatory parameters:

* `:method` - HTTP method (`:get`. `:post`, `:put`, `:patch`,  `:delete`)
* `:url` - URL (e.g.: "http://httpbin.org/ip")

Optional parameters:

* `:payload` -  a hash containing query params
* `:headers` -  a hash containing the request headers
* `:cookies` -  a hash containing the request cookies
* `:params` -  a hash that represent query-string separated from the preceding part by a question mark (`?`) a sequence of attributeâ€“value pairs separated by a delimiter (`&`)
* `:user` and `:password` -  for Basic Authentication
* `:max_redirects` -  maximum number of redirections (default to 10)


More detailed examples:

```crystal
Crest::Request.new(:get, "http://example.com/resource", headers: {"Content-Type" => "application/json"})
Crest::Request.new(:delete, "http://example.com/resource/1", params: {:lang => "ua"})
Crest::Request.new(:post, "http://example.com/resource", headers: {"Content-Type" => "application/json"}, payload: {:foo => "bar"})
Crest::Request.new(:patch, "http://example.com/resource/1", headers: {"Content-Type" => "application/json"}, payload: {:foo => "bar"})
Crest::Request.new(:get, "http://example.com/resource", user: "admin", password: "1234")
```

### Multipart

Yeah, that's right! This does multipart sends for you!

```crystal
file = File.open("#{__DIR__}/example.png")
Crest.post("http://example.com/upload", payload: {:image => file})
```

### JSON payload

`crest` does not speak JSON natively, so serialize your payload to a string before passing it to `crest`.

```crystal
Crest.post("http://example.com/", headers: {"Content-Type" => "application/json"}, payload: {:foo => "bar"}.to_json)
```

### Headers

Request headers can be set by passing a hash containing keys and values representing header names and values:

```crystal
response = Crest.get("http://httpbin.org/headers", headers: {"Authorization" => "Bearer cT0febFoD5lxAlNAXHo6g"})
response.headers
# => {"Authorization" => ["Bearer cT0febFoD5lxAlNAXHo6g"]}
```

### Cookies

`Request` and `Response` objects know about HTTP cookies, and will automatically extract and set headers for them as needed:

```crystal
response = Crest.get("http://httpbin.org/cookies/set", params: {"k1" => "v1", "k2" => "v2"})
response.cookies
# => {"k1" => "v1", "k2" => "v2"}

response = Crest.get("http://httpbin.org/cookies", cookies: {"k1" => "v1"})
response.cookies
# => {"k1" => "v1"}
```

### Basic authentication

For basic access authentication for an HTTP user agent you should to provide a user name and password when making a request.

```crystal
Crest.get("http://httpbin.org/basic-auth/user/passwd", user: "user", password: "passwd")
```

### Proxy

```crystal
Crest.get("http://httpbin.org/ip", p_addr: "localhost", p_port: 3128, p_user: "user", p_pass: "qwerty")
```

### Resource

```crystal
resource = Crest::Resource.new("http://localhost", headers: {"Content-Type" => "application/json"})
resource.get({"X-Something" => "1"})
```

### Resource Nesting

```crystal
site = Crest::Resource.new('http://example.com')
response = site["/api/article"].post({:title => "Hello world", :body => "Crystal is awesome!"})
```

### Exceptions

- for result codes between `200` and `207`, a `Crest::Response` will be returned
- for result codes `301`, `302`, `303` or `307`, the redirection will be followed and the request transformed into a `GET`
- for other cases, a `Crest::RequestFailed` holding the Response will be raised
- call `.response` on the exception to get the server's response

### Redirection

By default, `crest` will follow HTTP 30x redirection requests.

To disable automatic redirection, set `:max_redirects => 0`.

```crystal
Crest::Request.execute(method: :get, url: "http://httpbin.org/redirect/1", max_redirects: 0)
# Crest::RequestFailed: 302 Found
```

## Result handling

The result of a `Crest::Request` is a `Crest::Response` object.

Response objects have several useful methods.

- `Response#body`: The response body as a string
- `Response#status_code`: The HTTP response code
- `Response#headers`: A hash of HTTP response headers
- `Response#cookies`: A hash of HTTP cookies set by the server
- `Response#request`: The `Crest::Request` object used to make the request
- `Response#http_client_res`: The `HTTP::Client::Response` object
- `Response#history`: A list of each response received in a redirection chain
